        <h2>1. Data protection at a glance</h2>
        <h3>General information</h3>
        <p>The following notes provide a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit this website. Personal data is any data that can be used to identify you personally. Detailed information on the subject of data protection can be found in the full privacy policy below.</p>
        <h3>Data collection on this website</h3>
        <h4>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</h4>
        <p>Data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You can find the operator's contact details in the section "Responsible party" within this privacy policy.</p>
        <h4>How do we collect your data?</h4>
        <p>On the one hand, your data is collected when you communicate it to us. This may, for example, be data that you enter in a contact form.</p>
        <p>Other data is collected automatically or after your consent when you visit the website. This is primarily technical data (for example the browser and operating system used or the time the page was accessed). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter this website.</p>
        <h4>What do we use your data for?</h4>
        <p>Part of the data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyse your user behaviour. Where the website can be used to initiate or conclude contracts, transmitted data will also be processed for offers, orders or other requests.</p>

        <p>You have the right at any time to obtain free information about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data.

        <h2>2. General information and mandatory details</h2>
        <h3>Data protection</h3>
        <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
        <p>When you use this website, various personal data will be collected. Personal data is data that can be used to identify you personally. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
        <p>We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (for example when communicating by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
        <h3>Responsible party</h3>
        <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
        <p>KIZU Productions<br />
        Wilhelmstrasse 14<br />
        88250 Weingarten<br />
        Germany</p>
        <p>Phone: <a href="tel:+4917632817822">+49 (0) 176 328 17822</a><br />
        Email: <a href="mailto:info@kizuloge.com">info@kizuloge.com</a></p>
        <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (such as names, email addresses or similar).</p>
        <h3>Storage period</h3>
        <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for erasure or withdraw your consent to data processing, your data will be erased unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (for example tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case the data will be erased once these reasons no longer apply.</p>
        <h3>General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website</h3>
        <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR or Article 9 paragraph 2 letter a GDPR if special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 paragraph 1 GDPR are processed. In the event of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Article 49 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (for example via device fingerprinting), data processing is also carried out on the basis of Section 25 paragraph 1 TDDDG. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. If your data is required to fulfil a contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter c GDPR. Data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR. Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
        <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
        <p>In the course of our business activities we work together with various external parties. In some cases, it is also necessary to transfer personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if you have consented to this, if there is a legal obligation to do so, if we have a legitimate interest in transferring the data or if another legal basis permits the data to be transferred. When outsourcing processing to processors, we only pass on personal data on the basis of a contract on order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract on joint processing is concluded.</p>
        <h3>Withdrawal of your consent to data processing</h3>
        <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can withdraw consent that you have already given at any time. The lawfulness of the data processing carried out until the withdrawal remains unaffected by the withdrawal.</p>
        <h3>Right to object to data processing in special cases and to direct marketing (Article 21 GDPR)</h3>
        <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLE 6 PARAGRAPH 1 LETTER E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 PARAGRAPH 1 GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 PARAGRAPH 2 GDPR).</p>
        <h3>Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority</h3>
        <p>In the event of infringements of the GDPR, data subjects have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
        <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfilment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done if it is technically feasible.</p>
        <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or enquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
        <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
        <h3>Information, rectification and erasure</h3>
        <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to receive information free of charge at any time about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of the data processing and, if necessary, a right to rectify or erase this data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose and for further questions on the subject of personal data.</p>
        <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
        <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you dispute the accuracy of the personal data stored by us, we usually need time to check this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
          <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is carried out unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.</li>
          <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.</li>
          <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Article 21 paragraph 1 GDPR, your interests and ours must be weighed up. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from its storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>
        <h3>Objection to promotional emails</h3>
        <p>We hereby object to the use of contact data published within the scope of the legal notice obligation to send unsolicited advertising and information materials. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, for example via spam emails.</p>

        <p>When you visit one of our pages on which YouTube is embedded, a connection to YouTube servers is established. The YouTube server is informed about which of our pages you have visited.</p>
        <p>YouTube may also store various cookies on your device or use comparable technologies for recognition (for example device fingerprinting). In this way YouTube can obtain information about visitors to this website. Among other things, this information is used to collect video statistics, improve user friendliness and prevent fraud attempts. The data is also processed within the Google advertising network.</p>
        <p>If you are logged into your YouTube account, you enable YouTube to assign your browsing behaviour directly to your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.</p>

This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR. If corresponding consent has been requested, processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR and Section 25 paragraph 1 TDDDG, insofar as consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information on the user's device (for example device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG.

        <h3>SoundCloud</h3>
        <p>This website may integrate plugins of the social network SoundCloud (SoundCloud Limited, Berners House, 47-48 Berners Street, London W1T 3NF, United Kingdom). You can recognise the SoundCloud plugins by the SoundCloud logo on the relevant pages.</p>
        <p>When you visit this website, after the plugin is activated a direct connection is established between your browser and the SoundCloud server. SoundCloud therefore receives the information that you have visited this website with your IP address. If you click the "Like" or "Share" button while you are logged into your SoundCloud user account, you can link and/or share the content of this website on your SoundCloud profile. This enables SoundCloud to associate your visit to this website with your user account. We would like to point out that, as the provider of these pages, we have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or how it is used by SoundCloud.</p>
        <p>Data storage and analysis takes place on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in achieving the broadest possible visibility in social media. If corresponding consent has been requested, processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR and Section 25 paragraph 1 TDDDG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information on the user's device (for example device fingerprinting). Consent can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
        <p>The United Kingdom is regarded as a country with an adequate level of data protection. This means that the level of data protection is equivalent to that of the European Union.</p>
        <p>Further information can be found in SoundCloud's privacy policy: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pages/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://soundcloud.com/pages/privacy</a>.</p>

An overview of the Spotify plugins can be found at: <a href="https://developer.spotify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://developer.spotify.com</a>.</p>
        <p>When you visit this website via the plugin, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Spotify server. Spotify therefore receives the information that you have visited this website with your IP address. If you click the Spotify button while you are logged into your Spotify account, you can link the content of this website to your Spotify profile. This allows Spotify to associate the visit to this website with your user account.</p>
        <p>Please note that Spotify uses Google Analytics cookies when Spotify is used, so that your usage data may also be transmitted to Google when using Spotify. Google Analytics is a tool of the Google group designed to analyse user behaviour and is based in the USA. Spotify is solely responsible for this integration. As the website operator we have no influence on this processing.</p>
        <p>Data storage and analysis takes place on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the appealing acoustic design of the website. If the corresponding consent has been requested, processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR and Section 25 paragraph 1 TDDDG, insofar as the consent covers the storage of cookies or access to information on the user's device (for example device fingerprinting). Consent can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
        <p>Further information can be found in Spotify's privacy policy: <a href="https://www.spotify.com/en/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.spotify.com/en/legal/privacy-policy/</a>.</p>
