        <h2>1. Data protection at a glance</h2>
        <h3>General information</h3>
        <p>The following notes provide a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit this website. Personal data is any data that can be used to identify you personally. Detailed information on the subject of data protection can be found in the full privacy policy below.</p>
        <h3>Data collection on this website</h3>
        <h4>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</h4>
        <p>Data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You can find the operator's contact details in the section "Responsible party" within this privacy policy.</p>
        <h4>How do we collect your data?</h4>
        <p>On the one hand, your data is collected when you communicate it to us. This may, for example, be data that you enter in a contact form.</p>
        <p>Other data is collected automatically or after your consent when you visit the website. This is primarily technical data (for example the browser and operating system used or the time the page was accessed). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter this website.</p>
        <h4>What do we use your data for?</h4>
        <p>Part of the data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyse your user behaviour. Where the website can be used to initiate or conclude contracts, transmitted data will also be processed for offers, orders or other requests.</p>
        <h4>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h4>
        <p>You have the right at any time to obtain free information about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data.

Furthermore, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances.

        <h2>2. General information and mandatory details</h2>
        <h3>Data protection</h3>
        <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
        <p>When you use this website, various personal data will be collected. Personal data is data that can be used to identify you personally. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
        <p>We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (for example when communicating by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
        <h3>Responsible party</h3>
        <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
        <p>KIZU Productions<br />
        Wilhelmstrasse 14<br />
        88250 Weingarten<br />
        Germany</p>
        <p>Phone: <a href="tel:+4917632817822">+49 (0) 176 328 17822</a><br />
        Email: <a href="mailto:info@kizuloge.com">info@kizuloge.com</a></p>
        <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (such as names, email addresses or similar).</p>
        <h3>Storage period</h3>
        <p>Unless a more specific storage period is stated within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or withdraw your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (for example retention periods under tax or commercial law). In the latter case, deletion will take place once these reasons no longer apply.</p>
        <h3>Legal bases for processing</h3>
        <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR or Article 9 paragraph 2 letter a GDPR if special categories of data according to Article 9 paragraph 1 GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the processing is also based on Article 49 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (for example via device fingerprinting), the processing is additionally based on Section 25 paragraph 1 TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the performance of a contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter c GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR. The respective legal bases in individual cases are explained in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
        <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
        <p>In the course of our business activities we work with various external parties. In some cases, personal data must also be transferred to these third parties. We only disclose personal data to external parties if this is necessary for the performance of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (for example, forwarding data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the disclosure. When using processors, we disclose personal data of our customers only on the basis of a valid processing contract. In the case of joint processing, a joint controller agreement is concluded.</p>
        <h3>Withdrawal of your consent to data processing</h3>
        <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can withdraw consent that you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out up to the withdrawal remains unaffected by the withdrawal.</p>
        <h3>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct marketing (Article 21 GDPR)</h3>
        <p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ARTICLE 6 PARAGRAPH 1 LETTER E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME, FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 PARAGRAPH 1 GDPR).</p>
        <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS CONNECTED WITH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL THEN NO LONGER BE PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 PARAGRAPH 2 GDPR).</p>
        <h3>Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority</h3>
        <p>In the event of infringement of the GDPR, those affected have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
        <p>You have the right to have data that we process on the basis of your consent or in fulfilment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.</p>
        <h3>Information, rectification and erasure</h3>
        <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients and the purpose of data processing and, if applicable, a right to rectification or erasure of this data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose and for further questions on the subject of personal data.</p>
        <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
        <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
          <li>If the processing of your personal data happened or is happening unlawfully, you may request restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
          <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you require it for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
          <li>If you have objected pursuant to Article 21 paragraph 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data may, with the exception of storage, only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>
        <h3>Objection to promotional emails</h3>
        <p>The use of contact data published within the scope of the legal notice obligation for sending unsolicited advertising and information material is hereby rejected. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited advertising information, such as spam emails.</p>

        <h2>3. Data collection on this website</h2>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>Our Internet pages use so-called cookies. Cookies are small data packages that do not cause any damage to your end device. They are stored on your device either temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies). Session cookies are deleted automatically after your visit ends. Permanent cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them or your web browser deletes them automatically.</p>
        <p>Cookies can be set by us (first-party cookies) or by third parties (third-party cookies). Third-party cookies allow certain services provided by third-party companies to be integrated within websites (for example cookies for processing payment services).</p>
        <p>Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not work without them (for example shopping cart functions or the display of videos). Other cookies may be used to analyse user behaviour or for advertising purposes.</p>
        <p>Cookies that are necessary to carry out electronic communication, to provide certain functions you have requested or to optimise the website (for example cookies to measure the web audience) are stored on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies to ensure technically error-free and optimised provision of the services. If consent to the storage of cookies and similar recognition technologies has been requested, processing takes place exclusively on the basis of this consent (Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR and Section 25 paragraph 1 TDDDG). Consent can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
        <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and to allow cookies only in individual cases, to exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general, and to activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
        <p>You can find out which cookies and services are used on this website in this privacy policy.</p>
        <h3>Inquiries by email, phone or fax</h3>
        <p>If you contact us by email, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of handling your enquiry. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
        <p>The processing of this data is based on Article 6 paragraph 1 letter b GDPR if your enquiry is related to the fulfilment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in effectively processing the enquiries sent to us (Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR) or on your consent (Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR) if it has been requested. Consent can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
        <p>The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you ask us to delete it, withdraw your consent to storage, or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (for example after your enquiry has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions-especially statutory retention periods-remain unaffected.</p>

        <h2>5. Plugins and tools</h2>
        <h3>YouTube</h3>
        <p>This website integrates videos hosted on YouTube. The operator of YouTube is Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
        <p>When you visit one of our pages on which YouTube is embedded, a connection to YouTube servers is established. The YouTube server is informed about which of our pages you have visited.</p>
        <p>YouTube may also store various cookies on your device or use comparable technologies for recognition (for example device fingerprinting). In this way YouTube can obtain information about visitors to this website. Among other things, this information is used to collect video statistics, improve user friendliness and prevent fraud attempts. The data is also processed within the Google advertising network.</p>
        <p>If you are logged into your YouTube account, you enable YouTube to assign your browsing behaviour directly to your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.</p>
        <p>YouTube is used in the interest of providing an attractive presentation of our online offerings. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR. If corresponding consent has been requested, processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR and Section 25 paragraph 1 TDDDG, insofar as consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information on the user's device (for example device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. Consent can be withdrawn at any time.</p>

        <h3>SoundCloud</h3>
        <p>This website may integrate plugins of the social network SoundCloud (SoundCloud Limited, Berners House, 47-48 Berners Street, London W1T 3NF, United Kingdom). You can recognise the SoundCloud plugins by the SoundCloud logo on the relevant pages.</p>
        <p>When you visit this website, after the plugin is activated a direct connection is established between your browser and the SoundCloud server. SoundCloud therefore receives the information that you have visited this website with your IP address. If you click the "Like" or "Share" button while you are logged into your SoundCloud user account, you can link and/or share the content of this website on your SoundCloud profile. This enables SoundCloud to associate your visit to this website with your user account. We would like to point out that, as the provider of these pages, we have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or how it is used by SoundCloud.</p>
        <p>Data storage and analysis takes place on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in achieving the broadest possible visibility in social media. If corresponding consent has been requested, processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR and Section 25 paragraph 1 TDDDG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information on the user's device (for example device fingerprinting). Consent can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
        <p>The United Kingdom is regarded as a country with an adequate level of data protection. This means that the level of data protection is equivalent to that of the European Union.</p>

        <p>This website integrates functions of the music service Spotify. The provider is Spotify AB, Birger Jarlsgatan 61, 113 56 Stockholm, Sweden. You can recognise Spotify plugins by the green logo on this website. An overview of the Spotify plugins can be found at: <a href="https://developer.spotify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://developer.spotify.com</a>.</p>
        <p>When you visit this website via the plugin, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Spotify server. Spotify therefore receives the information that you have visited this website with your IP address. If you click the Spotify button while you are logged into your Spotify account, you can link the content of this website to your Spotify profile. This allows Spotify to associate the visit to this website with your user account.</p>
        <p>Please note that Spotify uses Google Analytics cookies when Spotify is used, so that your usage data may also be transmitted to Google when using Spotify. Google Analytics is a tool of the Google group designed to analyse user behaviour and is based in the USA. Spotify is solely responsible for this integration. As the website operator we have no influence on this processing.</p>
        <p>Data storage and analysis takes place on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the appealing acoustic design of the website. If the corresponding consent has been requested, processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR and Section 25 paragraph 1 TDDDG, insofar as the consent covers the storage of cookies or access to information on the user's device (for example device fingerprinting). Consent can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
